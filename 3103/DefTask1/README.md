Arrhythmia Classification Project 🩺
This project uses machine learning to classify heartbeats as either Normal or exhibiting Arrhythmia based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. A significant part of this project involves robust data cleaning and preprocessing to handle a complex and messy real-world dataset.

📝 Project Overview
The primary goal is to build and compare several classification models to determine which is most effective at identifying cardiac arrhythmia. The workflow includes:

Data Cleaning: The raw dataset contains numerous missing values and sparse columns which must be handled before analysis.

Problem Simplification: The original dataset has 16 classes, many of which are very rare. The problem is simplified into a more stable binary classification task: Normal vs. Arrhythmia.

Model Comparison: Five different machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to find the best performer for this specific task.

📊 The Dataset
This project uses the Arrhythmia Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a well-known resource for medical data.

Source: UCI Arrhythmia Dataset

The script requires the arrhythmia.data file to be downloaded and placed in the project folder.

Key Challenges of this Dataset:
Missing Values: The data contains a significant number of missing entries, represented by ?.

High Dimensionality: There are 279 original features, requiring careful preprocessing.

Class Imbalance: The original 16 classes are highly imbalanced, necessitating the binary classification approach used in this project.

Conclusion: Random Forest is the Winner 🏆
The Random Forest model is the best performer for this task with an accuracy of 79.76%. As an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, it is particularly effective at finding complex patterns in high-dimensional data like this ECG dataset, making it more robust than the individual models.
